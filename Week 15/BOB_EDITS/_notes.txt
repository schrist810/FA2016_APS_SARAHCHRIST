notes for sarah

=> Grid 

margins don’t account for grid, first and last column smaller than the rest
12 columns is good, (/2, /3, /4, /6), but some pages have more, 22 not good

Use columns in indesign, not guides, consistent across each page, can’t be selected or moved.

get rounded and even text sizes
