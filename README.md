Project Title - Website re-design and branding

Total Project Deliverable Summary - I would like to focus on re-branding and designing a new website for a non-profit organization. “designing for good” as it may be. I know there are many underserved and wonderful organizations out there that don’t have the budget for good design, and I would love to focus my efforts on giving one a facelift to boost the impact of the cause. 

Technology List - 
I will mainly plan on working in the Adobe Creative Suite using InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop. Text editing if necessary in Word, and a web browser for research.
